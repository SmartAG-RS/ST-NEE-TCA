# ST-NEE-TCA
This repository contains the data used for analyzing the relationship between vegetation health, water status, surface features, and their influence on NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange). It is organized into two main folders:
## NEE_daily_data
This folder contains the daily NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) data for the sites used in the study. The data is collected and organized by the corresponding site, with each file representing the NEE measurements taken on a daily basis.
### File Structure:
- Each file contains NEE data for a specific site, formatted in a structured way (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- The data includes various environmental parameters, such as time and NEE values.
## Remote Sensing Data
This folder stores the remote sensing data derived from the Landsat 5789 satellite for the sites used in the analysis. The data includes vegetation indices calculated for each site, which are related to NEE. These vegetation indices provide crucial insights into vegetation health, which directly or indirectly impacts NEE.
### File Structure:
The files contain calculated vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI) for each site.
The data is organized by site and time period, aligning with the corresponding NEE data.
Public Data Access
The public data sources used in this study are available for download through the links provided in the article. These links include the respective datasets for NEE and remote sensing data.
## Usage
You can use the data in this repository to explore how vegetation health, water status, and surface features affect NEE through direct or indirect relationships. If you plan to use the data for research or other purposes, please cite the source as per the guidelines provided in the associated article.
